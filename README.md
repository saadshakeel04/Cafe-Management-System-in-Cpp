DESCRIPTION: 
                             
This project is CLI based program which reflects the working of a Café. It is basically a Café Management System.
The working of this program is such that there are 2 users who can interact with the program.
One is “Admin” and the other is “Employee”. Both of them have their own signup menu which includes their ID and Password.
So, Admin has its own authorities which includes viewing and managing the Menu and the Employees. Such as deleting the already ones and adding new ones.
Now, moving on to the options for Employee, they include some basic ones such as viewing the Menu and taking orders from the user (just like in real life the employee asks customer for order).
After taking the order from user, the program then displays the total bill for the user to pay.
